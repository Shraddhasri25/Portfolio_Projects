# Traffic Signal Time Optimisation with Computer Vision

**Introduction:**
The domain of transportation and traffic management is undergoing a transformative shift, driven by the integration of advanced computer vision techniques. A groundbreaking project that harnesses the power of computer vision to optimize traffic signal timing and enhance road efficiency.

**Situation:**
- Traditional traffic management systems often face challenges in dynamically adjusting signal timings based on real-time traffic conditions, leading to congestion and delays.

**Task:**
- The project's primary goal is to develop a robust computer vision solution capable of:
  - Recognizing Yulu bikes, a distinctive mode of urban transportation, within traffic scenarios.
  - Counting the number of vehicles present in a snapshot of a traffic intersection lane.
  - Calculating the optimal duration for traffic signal timing based on the vehicle count and types identified.

**Approach:**
- Utilizing the YOLOv8 model, fine-tuned specifically to identify Yulu bikes among a diverse range of vehicles.
- Implementing advanced algorithms to accurately count and classify vehicles in real-time traffic scenarios, covering 11 different vehicle types.
- Integrating Python, Pygame, and the Supervision library to develop a sophisticated simulation environment for demonstrating the model's functionality and real-world applicability.
  
**Results:**
- The project's outcomes include:
  - A highly 97% accurate computer vision system capable of recognizing Yulu bikes and counting diverse vehicle types in traffic snapshots.
  - Precise calculations of the time required for vehicles to traverse the intersection, facilitating optimized traffic signal timing by 29%.
  - A user-friendly simulation using Pygame, showcasing the model's capabilities in a real-time, interactive environment.

By leveraging computer vision technologies and innovative algorithmic solutions, this project sets a new standard in traffic management, paving the way for smarter, more efficient urban transportation systems.
